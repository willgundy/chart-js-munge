Deploy your code on netlify and write tested "munge functions" for each chart. Submit a PR/deployment as usual.

## Charts to make

1) Bar chart showing number of customers by each purchase frequency.
1) Line chart showing number of customers by each cool factor.
1) Pie chart showing number of customers by each gender. Make sure you have enough colors in your chart data to make the pie chart readable.

### Stretch goals
1) Bar chart showing average cool factor of each age demographic (0 - 10, 11 - 20, 21 - 30, etc)
1) Line chart showing most frequent "purchase frequency" for each decade (1920 - 1929, 1930 - 1939, 1940 - 1949, etc)
1) Line chart with two datasets: age of the oldest customer from each decade (1920 - 1929, 1930 - 1939, 1940 - 1949, etc), and cool factor of the "coolest" customer from each decade (1920 - 1929, 1930 - 1939, 1940 - 1949, etc)
